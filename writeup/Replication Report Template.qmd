## Introduction

Justification: 

It is widely believed that the approximate number system (ANS) supports formation of non-exact representation of quantities in adults, children, and even animals (Dehaene, 2011). ANS affords abilities like quickly discriminating two different numerical quantities or estimating the amount of items. The acuity of discrimintation is proportional to the ratio of the two quantities, and is found to predict future math learning performance. However, debate exists around whether numerosity is the main perceptual feature driving ANS, or numerosity is actually estimated from non-numerical visual features. This paper attempted to reconcile this debate by testing deep neural networks and human participants in the same task, adopting a stimulus space that could disentangle the contribution of numerical and non-numerical features. For this replication project, I will try to recreate the human experiment in this paper. It is related to my side research interest of probing ANS in vision language models. 

Methods: 

In the original study, the researchers generated a database of 21970 images of dot arrays. They theorized that there are 3 dimensions that the dot array could vary on: numerosity, size (intrinsic), spacing (extrinsic). To test these, they picked 13 levels of numerosities, 13 levels of sizes and 13 levels of spacings, each put evenly on a log scale. That yielded 2197 combinations. They then generated 10 random dot images for each combination, resulting in 21970 images. For human experiment, they randomly sampled 300 pairs of dot images (10% with ratio between 0.5 and 0.6; 20% with ratio between 0.6 and 0.7; 30% with ratio between 0.7 and 0.8; 40% with ratio between 0.8 and 0.9). Stimuli were projected on a 19-inch color screen. The task consisted in 3 blocks of 100 trials each, for a total of 300 trials. Participants indicated which image in the pair had more dots by pressing left or right arrows on keyboard. (estimated 3-5 s per trial, about half to one hour for each participant) 

I think there might be 2 chanllenges: first, the original project data is on osf, but coded in matlab; second, it might be hard (and maybe uneccesary) to follow the original procedure of generating 21970 images (beacuse most of them were used for the purpose of model training and testing), and it may be unrealistic to have 40 participants each complete a 1-hour session.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
